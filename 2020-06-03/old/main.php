<h1>Welcome!</h1>

I am currently a first-year Master's student in Computer Science at 
Stanford University, working as a research assistant for the 
<a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/">Stanford Network Analysis Project</a>
with <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/">Jure Leskovec</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dshahaf/">Dafna Shahaf</a>.
</p>

<p>
My primary research interests are in web and social network analysis, algorithmic economics,
machine learning, evolutionary computation, and musical algorithms. In my free
time I enjoy <a href="http://tattvamasi.bandcamp.com">creating hip hop music</a>,
playing the guitar and cello, <a href="/?s=books">reading</a>, and learning to
speak Chinese and Hindi. Feel free to <a href="mailto:jjacobs3@cs.stanford.edu">email me</a>
with any questions or comments.
