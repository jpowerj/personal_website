<h1>The Planar Hamiltonian Cycle Problem</h1>

<p>During the fall semester of 2011 at University of Maryland, I conducted an independent study with <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch">Dr. William Gasarch</a>
on the topic of investigating the proof that the Planar Hamiltonian Cycle Problem is NP-complete.
