It was not to give them his analysis of this extraordinary outburst but to take them on a tour of the presidential palace, where he had undertaken a costly renovation of its sumptuous ballroom. He told them that Brigitte, the First Lady, was supervising the project, and praised her choice of a €300,000 carpet woven at the Royal Manufactory of Aubusson. ‘We are at a moment in the life of the nation when it is necessary to invest’, he declared, and since the Élysée was the showcase of France, it had to be a priority.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-1" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-1"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>1</sup></a> For a president who regards the King’s death during the Revolution as a permanent trauma for the French people, and considers it his mission to occupy the vacated space, this disconnect between the preoccupations of the nation and its head of state—the yellow vests were initially supported by 75 per cent of the population, according to opinion polls—could be called a Louis <span class="small-caps">xvi </span>moment, comparable to the Bourbon monarch’s laconic diary entry for 14 July 1789, the day the Bastille fell: ‘Nothing.’  </p>
            <p class="body_text">The executive had simply not taken stock of the magnitude of the yellow-vest mobilization, nor of the accumulated grievances that lay behind it. The insurgency was regarded as one more episode of futile protest against its neoliberal reforms. The experience of Macron’s first two years in office—the repeated failure of massive demonstrations to prevent his revisions of the labour code, overhaul of the state rail operator and cuts to pensions—led Paris to believe that it could ride out this latest unrest. It deemed trivial the yellow vests’ main complaint: an increase in fuel tax of 6.5 cents per litre for diesel and 2.9 cents for petrol, scheduled for 1 January 2019 and coming on top of similar rises implemented in 2018. The stated purpose of the carbon tax was to reduce fossil-fuel consumption, an ecological gesture intended to dispel the negative impression created by the resignation of Nicolas Hulot, the popular environment minister, who had declared himself frustrated by the government’s lack of political will on green issues.  </p>
            <p class="body_text">Persuaded of their strength and of the weakness of the mobilization against them, the President and his ministers initially refused to listen to the demonstrators. Macron instead tried to discredit them as ‘a heinous mob’ and latter-day ‘Poujadists’—a reference to the populist anti-tax campaigners of the 1950s, whose discourse had included anti-intellectual, xenophobic and antisemitic themes. The spokespersons for the<em> gilets jaunes</em> ‘target Jews, foreigners, homosexuals’, he alleged, even though the movement had, since its inception, rejected all self-proclaimed representatives.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-2" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-2"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>2</sup></a> Christophe Castaner, the interior minister, labelled the activists ‘seditious far-rightists’—despite their adamant refusal to associate with any political party—and compared them to the Taliban for the (possibly accidental) destruction of a garish sculpture on a roundabout in Châtellerault on 16 December, after a barricade was set on fire to forestall an attempt by police to clear the road.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-3" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-3"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>3</sup></a></p>
            <p class="body_text">Truth be told, very few politicians or commentators had anticipated such disturbances, or proved able to interpret them once they became entrenched—despite a burgeoning literature on the subject. How could a leaderless grassroots movement, involving often quite small groups of protesters, monopolize the national news, capture the attention of the wider world and destabilize a government that had swept to power by a landslide victory in 2017? As Jacques Rancière has suggested, it is as difficult to understand why some people mobilize when confronted with situations they regard as unacceptable, as it is to understand why others in similar or even worse circumstances do not.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-4" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-4"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>4</sup></a> The <em>gilets jaunes </em>upsurge appears all the more remarkable when one considers that most of its adherents had never participated in a demonstration before and refuse any political or union affiliation.

            </h4>
            <p class="body_text">Commentators who derided the initial grievance of the <em>gilets jaunes </em>ignored the fact that opposition to the fuel-tax increase had a deeper meaning, rooted in the social transformations of the past decades, which recent measures have merely aggravated.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-5" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-5"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>5</sup></a> Worsening economic inequality since the 1980s was relatively well tolerated as long as living standards continued to improve for everyone, even if not at the same pace. But since the 2008 financial crisis, the income of the bottom 40 per cent of the population has dropped. Pauperization has mainly afflicted those who were already the most disadvantaged, among whom joblessness and under-employment became increasingly rife. At the same time, the cost of housing, energy, insurance and school meals has risen faster than the overall rate of inflation. These trends have left the lowest segment of the population with a reduced budget to meet all their other needs.  </p>
            <p class="body_text">In parallel, rising rents and house prices, especially in large cities, have forced more and more people on tight incomes to move further away from urban centres, where many of them work. Public transport remains chronically underdeveloped in these hinterlands, so owning a car is essential. The soaring cost of fuel has therefore eaten into household budgets. In rural areas the problem is even more acute. There, the atrophy of public services—from post offices to train stations, hospitals to schools—obliges people to drive into larger towns to access any sort of amenity. Thus, whereas the tax increases had little impact on privileged social layers, since fuel represents only a small proportion of their budgets, they constituted a real financial burden for people living at a distance from the cities. It is estimated that the carbon tax weighs five times more heavily on the bottom decile than on the top, even though the former produces much less pollution than the latter. Besides, the car industry itself was exempted from this environmental levy. On top of these injustices, drivers of diesel cars saw the extra tax hike for their vehicles as being particularly unfair, because the government has encouraged the use of this type of engine for decades, and so it is found today in more than 60 per cent of all personal vehicles in France—mostly the older ones owned by lower-income road-users. Mocked as archetypal rednecks by government spokesperson Benjamin Griveaux, the ‘drivers of diesel cars who smoke fags’ thus had every reason to don a yellow tabard.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-6" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-6"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>6</sup></a> It is obvious that the Parisian commentariat, which enjoys the use of chauffeurs, Uber and the Métro to move around the city, as well as hybrid cars stowed away in the country houses where they spend their weekends, has had a difficult time understanding these earthly concerns about a several-cent increase in the price of fuel. </p>
            <p class="body_text">This contemptuous attitude, fully shared and overtly expressed by the authorities, who see the protesters as ‘stupid, brutal, thugs, fascist, reactionary, vulgar’—in the words of David Guilbaud, a high state official, quoting the language of his colleagues—has reinforced the sense of social relegation among the disregarded classes.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-7" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-7"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>7</sup></a> The President himself has made multiple disparaging or condescending public interventions of this kind: dismissing his critics as ‘slackers and cynics’; describing women laid off from a slaughterhouse as ‘mostly illiterates’; drawing a contrast between ‘people who succeed and people who are nothing’; deploring that ‘we are putting crazy amounts of dough into minimum social benefits’; telling a young jobseeker that ‘I’ll cross the street and I’ll find you something’; and commenting, in reference to the yellow vests, that ‘we must make those who suffer hardship take responsibility because some behave well but others screw around’.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-8" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-8"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>8</sup></a> These incendiary statements, which a late act of contrition in his television address of 10 December could not erase from collective memory, probably explain why the January polls showed that 68 per cent of the French population find Macron arrogant and that he is the most unpopular French president in the history of the Fifth Republic, with only 23 per cent holding a positive opinion of him.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-9" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-9"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>9</sup></a> As the historian Gérard Noiriel notes, ‘popular struggles almost always involve the denunciation of the disdain of the powerful, and that of the yellow vests only confirms this rule.’<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-10" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-10"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>10</sup></a></p>
            <p class="body_text">But Macron’s verbal haughtiness is not the only cause of the spectacular collapse in his approval ratings. For the protesters, his deeds, more than his words, manifest his scornful indifference to their condition. The first actions of the newly elected President left no doubt about his political orientation. To the applause of business leaders, the former Rothschild banker abolished the solidarity tax on wealth, replacing it with a levy on real estate from which financial assets were exempt, and cut corporation tax as well as employer payroll charges. Conversely, to balance the state’s budget, housing benefit, family allowances and pensions were all reduced. Not surprisingly, Macron soon earned the sobriquet ‘President of the rich’. His justification for these policies rested on the hackneyed trickle-down theory, according to which reduced taxes on the wealthy and corporations stimulate investment, create jobs and eventually prove beneficial to all. But this did not convince the majority of the population, who understood that the man they had elected because he claimed to be neither right nor left was in fact a typical neoliberal. Far from rejuvenating the political world, as he had promised during his campaign, Macron seemed merely to represent the old politics in new garb.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-11" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-11"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>11</sup></a> This is probably why the yellow vests immediately obtained such an extraordinary measure of public support, despite the disruption they are causing to many people’s daily lives. Although the number of protesters on the streets on any given day has rarely exceeded 100,000, the majority of the population who expressed sympathy with them in the polls should be regarded as demonstrators by proxy.  </p>

              <em>Unidentified political object </em>
            </h4>
            <p class="body_text">But is it even legitimate to call the protests of the yellow vests a movement? Several features of those protests run against this characterization, particularly if one considers how the mobilization developed in the closing weeks of 2018. First, rather than being a coordinated demonstration, it is a spontaneous uprising. Blockades are agreed upon between neighbours and friends. Improvised protests take place at venues chosen at the last minute via social media. Most of the time, no permission is solicited from the authorities, which have been all too ready to declare these rallies illegal and proceed to make arrests among anyone gathered in a group. Second, no leaders or spokespersons emerged from their ranks. Those who put themselves forward to liaise with the authorities or accepted invitations onto talk shows were immediately criticized, and sometimes even threatened. Third, no single watchword or programme unified the participants. Although certain themes recurred, on tax justice in particular, the most frequent slogans heard were against Macron himself, confirming the general mood of disaffection with the President. This unconventional mobilization can be regarded, at least in part, as a consequence of Macron’s strategy of marginalizing ‘intermediate bodies’: traditional parties, crushed at the polls, with the exception of the National Front; trade unions, discarded in the labour-reform process; and non-governmental organizations, which the President has simply ignored. In conformity with his lofty conception of the sovereign, Macron wanted to have ‘the people’ as his only interlocutor. Upon discovering that his honeymoon with voters had ended, however, with only 28 per cent of the population declaring they trusted the President—the lowest-ever score in the annual poll on institutions—he was discountenanced and paralyzed.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-12" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-12"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>12</sup></a></p>
            <p class="body_text">Opposition parties and the unions were also disconcerted by this peculiar mobilization, with its obscure social base, unusual practices and unclear aims—all the more so since it somewhat discredited their own, less effective forms of action to contest the government’s policies. Politicians were hesitant to support a protest wave depicted by the authorities and the mainstream media as violent, uncontrollable and leaning to the far right. They were all the less inclined to do so since the protesters strongly rejected all attempts to instrumentalize their struggle. It was Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s Les Insoumis who most openly backed the yellow vests, while Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National did so in a more discreet and perhaps more effective way. Polling about voting intentions for the May 2019 elections to the European Parliament indicates that the latter has benefitted more from the crisis than the former, whose constituency has dropped. Meanwhile the core of Macron’s support remains solid.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-13" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-13"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>13</sup></a> For their part, the major unions stated that they understood the anger of the yellow vests and shared their concern about purchasing power, although they were more cautious when it came to the demand for reduced taxation, since tax is the main instrument for redistribution. Locally, however, in Marseilles for instance, trade unionists joined the protesters, arguing that they shared much in common. </p>
            <p class="body_text">A major reason for the discomfort felt by public figures is the difficulty of apprehending who the protesters are. It is certainly the case that the very form taken by the mobilization renders any analysis of its socio-demographic composition problematic. However, studies have been done <em>in situ</em> at the roundabouts, via social media and through opinion polls.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-14" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-14"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>14</sup></a> The observations gleaned so far by journalists and sociologists across the country do suggest some general traits. First, the yellow vests are a very heterogeneous group. Most have no experience of engagement in social movements, organized labour or political parties. Second, they combine men and women—the latter unusually well represented, at 45 per cent of the total—pensioners and workers, craftsmen and tradesmen, nurses and housekeepers, students and unemployed. Most adherents come from the upper-working class or the lower-middle class, drawn together by the shared experience of their income being progressively squeezed by tax hikes and rising expenses. Third, most reside in the distant outskirts of cities, as well as in depopulated rural areas, where there is a painful sense of abandonment by the state. The expression ‘peripheral France’, so often used to characterize them, should thus be taken in the polysemous sense of those who occupy—or regard themselves as occupying—a political, social and spatial periphery. In the opinion of sociologist Serge Paugam, the yellow-vest movement represents ‘the revenge of the invisible’ against the ‘social contempt’ of the elites.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-15" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-15"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>15</sup></a></p>
            <p class="body_text">But as the geographer Hervé Le Bras has shown, contrary to a common perception, the movement’s distribution across the country does not run in parallel to the far-right vote. Nor does it cluster in the most impoverished territories.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-16" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-16"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>16</sup></a> Significantly, Seine-Saint-Denis, which is the most deprived French department, with a large immigrant population, has seen neither road blockades nor street demonstrations. This is indeed, paradoxically, one of the most obvious and yet least noticed characteristics of the <em>gilets jaunes</em>: they do not include the most disadvantaged social elements of all. The denizens of housing projects administratively named ‘neighbourhoods in difficulty’ or ‘urban sensitive zones’, where socioeconomic and ethnoracial segregation is most pronounced, have been absent from the mobilization, in contrast to their leading role in previous bouts of unrest. Mostly of African descent, they suffer the highest rates of unemployment and poverty. Many households do not own a car. They see very little investment in public services, encountering the state in the form of law-enforcement officers rather than social workers. Their schools are chronically short of teachers. When interviewed, they declare that they do not really identify with a movement that is mostly white. While not expressing disapproval of the protests, they nevertheless find it ironic that the yellow vests seem to be discovering what they have experienced themselves for decades: social marginalization, economic hardship and police violence—processes no one seemed to care about until now.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-17" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-17"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>17</sup></a></p>

              <em>Popular power </em>
            </h4>
            <p class="body_text">Although the revolt has articulated an extraordinarily diverse range of grievances, there are two major themes running through the yellow vests’ programme: social justice and democratic renewal.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-18" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-18"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>18</sup></a> The first of these themes is principally focused on taxation, with recent changes in the tax code deemed wholly unfair. The most popular demand is for the restoration of the solidarity tax on the wealthy. But the issue of purchasing power is also central. This translates into a call for increases to the minimum wage and minimum pension. Interestingly, the discourse of the yellow vests displaces the social question from the traditional focus on poverty to a more explosive discussion about inequality. For instance, they propose a more progressive tax system, the abolition of lifelong benefits for former presidents, and a maximum of twenty-five students per class to help improve the very poor performance of France’s education system in comparison with other countries. They also express their solidarity towards the most disadvantaged. Among the forty-two demands that the protesters eventually compiled in January, one was for ‘zero homelessness’—one of Macron’s promises before his election—and another was for better treatment of asylum-seekers, including improved security, housing, food and education. Contrary to the French President’s insinuations, and confounding the hopes of Matteo Salvini, Italy’s interior minister, who pledged the yellow vests his support, the majority of protesters did not manifest any hostility toward migrants. Instead, they called for ‘a real politics of integration’. This positioning does not, of course, preclude a sympathy for the far right among a minority of participants.  </p>
            <p class="body_text">On the other hand, the shortcomings of France’s representative democracy were unreservedly denounced. With a president chosen by less than 25 per cent of the electorate in the first round of voting, and a parliament lacking a single blue-collar representative—20 per cent of the active population—neither the executive nor the legislative branch can be said to properly represent the people. Moreover, the presidentialist cast of the Fifth Republic has taken an extreme form in the past two years, as Macron implements his ‘Jupiterian style’, bypassing parliament to decide on everything himself, dismissing all mediations.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-19" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-19"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>19</sup></a> Opposing this autocratic form of governance, in which the sovereign only thinks of his relation to the people in pedagogical terms—to explain to them why he governs the way he does—the yellow vests propose acephalous assemblies, egalitarian debates and solidarity practices. Their flagship proposal is for the consultation of the population by referendum, on topics petitioned by the citizenry, without the intervention of either president or parliament, as is the practice in Switzerland and Italy. They also demand an extension of the president’s term of office from five to seven years, so that representatives are no longer elected immediately after the head of state, which virtually guarantees that the majority of the National Assembly will belong to his party and docilely follow his instructions. For the <em>gilets jaunes</em>, such a constitutional change would help to make ‘the people’s voice heard’. Of course, many on the left have long been much more radical, pressing for a Sixth Republic. </p>
            <p class="body_text">The heterogeneity of the yellow vests, the diversity of their demands and, more than anything, their success with public opinion, has led to erratic and contradictory reactions on the part of the government. Three moments in particular stand out. Initially, while the President remained silent for an unusually long period of time, his government held fast to its policies, expecting that the mobilization would peter out as the Christmas holiday approached. Prime Minister Édouard Philippe declared that the minimum wage would not be raised, since this would be inconsistent with the reduction of levies on corporations, and that the tax increase on fuel would be maintained in the name of environmental protection. In the supposed contest between those who worry about what they have left at the ‘end of the month’ and those more concerned about the ‘end of the world’, the government was on the side of the latter—a rhetorical position that rings hollow, given Macron’s regressive policies on pesticides, nuclear plants and the extractive industries.  </p>
            <p class="body_text">Then, as the protests continued and some politicians within the presidential majority called for a less dismissive attitude, a series of concessions were made, with ambiguous implications for social inequality and economic stability. The fuel increase was postponed and eventually cancelled altogether. The minimum wage was raised via a special premium paid by the state instead of the employer, thus transferring the cost to taxpayers. Overtime payments were stripped of taxes and charges—irrelevant for employees at the bottom of the pay scale, who do not make enough money to pay tax on their earnings. Retirees on the lowest income received an exemption from a new surcharge, yet pensions were de-indexed from inflation for the first time, making it possible for their real value to decline. Basic welfare benefits were not raised, and the solidarity tax on wealth was not restored. This package of measures was presented by Macron as a major ‘social turn’, but it did nothing to help the most precarious segments of the population, while sparing the corporate world and the most privileged, and also placed a heavy burden on the state’s finances, deepening its deficit and auguring further cuts to public services.  </p>
            <p class="body_text">Finally, on 13 January, confronted with continuing unrest, the President attempted to circumvent the yellow vests and arrest their momentum by announcing a ‘great national debate’, lasting three months and open to everyone. Although this was presented as a shift from the vertical style that has characterized Macron’s first years in power to a more horizontalist mode of governing, there are many indications that the President has rigged the whole process. The four themes and eighty-two questions to guide the discussion were all decided in advance.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-20" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-20"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>20</sup></a> They correspond in part to reforms that were already in preparation—for instance, the reduction of the number of representatives and senators—and use formulations that predetermine the response: ‘To decrease taxes and reduce the debt, which public expenditures must be cut in order of priority?’ Certain topics deemed crucial by the yellow vests—citizen referenda, restoration of the solidarity tax on wealth, measures to increase people’s purchasing power—have been excluded <em>a priori</em>. Others have been added despite bearing no relation whatever to the protesters’ demands, sometimes with a clearly divisive intention. This is particularly the case with the questions on <em>laïcité</em>, which merely perpetuate the state’s targeting of France’s Muslim minority—‘How do you propose to strengthen secularist principles in relations between the state and the religions in our country?’—and immigration, which pander to the conservative party, Les Républicains: ‘Do you wish us to establish annual quotas defined by parliament?’ The organization of the debate is under the control of two ministers, and the framework for analysing the information produced is opaque. The National Commission for Public Debates, which had been asked to oversee the process so as to ensure its transparency and neutrality, decided to withdraw, as its proposals had not been respected. The Commission’s president, Chantal Jouanno, criticized the debate’s lack of impartiality and its paternalistic orientation. In an opinion poll on 21 January, the majority of people had a positive view of the initiative, but 62 per cent thought that the government would not take what came out of it into account. Among people sympathetic to the yellow vests, this pessimism was even more widespread—79 per cent.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-21" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-21"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>21</sup></a></p>

In the absence of data from the interior minister, a non-exhaustive count of casualties by the Against State Violence collective, confirmed by independent journalist David Dufresne, indicates that 111 individuals had been seriously wounded by the first week of January.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-23" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-23"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>23</sup></a> Most injuries were caused by Flash-Ball rubber-pellet guns and Sting-Ball grenades, riot-control devices that are not used in most European countries. An eighty-year-old woman died after being hit by a grenade. Three individuals fell into a coma after they were shot with a rubber ball. Four had a hand blown off. Eighteen lost an eye. Two-thirds of the victims were shot in the head, causing brain injuries, even though the weapons in question are supposed to be targeted at the trunk and limbs. A war reporter, who had avoided injury while covering Bosnia, Afghanistan, Libya, Chad, Iraq and Syria, was wounded for the first time in Paris. Indeed, people filming the demonstrations, including journalists, were specifically targeted by the police.  </p>
            <p class="body_text">On 15 January, Christophe Castaner declared that he ‘was not aware of any policeman or gendarme who had attacked yellow vests’.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-24" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-24"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>24</sup></a> His denial signalled that the government would support law-enforcement agents, whatever degree of physical force they resorted to. Five days later, confronted by critics about what they called ‘state lying’, a government spokesperson finally acknowledged the existence of 81 investigations conducted by the Inspectorate of the National Police into violence perpetrated by officers. However, the unusual brutality of the police cannot simply be attributed to the initiative of rank-and-file agents; it is the consequence of the recent evolution of state policies. After the terrorist attacks of 2015, a state of emergency was declared. Two days before it officially ended on 1 November 2017, Macron put a new security law to a vote in parliament.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-25" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-25"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>25</sup></a> It included most of the measures until then limited to the state of emergency, in particular the extension of the prerogatives of the police and the licence to prohibit demonstrations. Powers originally justified as necessary for anti-terror operations have become the habitual form of police intervention to control protests. This includes the presence of snipers on the roofs of buildings—confirmed by police unions—the possession of assault rifles and the use of mutilating weapons. What was the exception has become the norm.  </p>

            <h4 id="H34905-05">
              <em>Spectacle of violence </em>
            </h4>
            <p class="body_text">Remarkably, however, during the first six weeks of protests, the national and international media remained completely silent regarding these casualties. They did not report on the violence of the police; they were instead mesmerized by the violence of the crowd. Television broadcasts played images of destruction and looting on the Champs-Élysées over and over again. Newspaper front pages showed night photos of barricades on fire, while editorials described scenes of chaos. During the demonstration of 5 January, a former boxing champion was filmed punching a police officer, who protected himself behind his shield and was only slightly injured. This made the headlines for several days, generating indignant reactions from the government, police unions and media pundits. No mention was made of the seven individuals who, that same day, had been seriously wounded by police, suffering brain injuries, facial wounds or the loss of an eye. The reasons why most media outlets produced this selective representation of the movement are probably multiple: they relied excessively on the official version of events put out by the authorities; some anticipated the expectations of their proprietors, who are often connected to the government, while others simply felt contempt toward the yellow vests; above all, they looked for stories and images that would attract an audience. </p>
            <p class="body_text">As the sociologist Laurent Mucchielli has written, ‘violence produces effects of astonishment/fascination/repulsion which prevent thinking’.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-26" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-26"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>26</sup></a> In that regard, sensationalist footage and alarmist accounts may lead the public to forget that the presence of violent groups or individuals has been a common feature of French protests for decades and that, in the case of peasant unrest, public edifices were burned down, without provoking such an outcry. The violence at some <em>gilets jaunes </em>rallies is undisputable. However, the defacement of the Arc de Triomphe during the 1 December protest in Paris inspired more emotion and denunciation than the deaths of eight people killed by the collapse of a dilapidated building in the centre of Marseilles, where local residents and yellow vests demonstrated peacefully on 2 December against the appalling housing conditions of the poor—as if the ‘violence’ of graffiti on a national monument was more scandalous than the violence of lethal negligence by public authorities. And when Macron claimed accusingly that ten people had died because of road blockades, he was actually referring to the unfortunate victims of traffic accidents caused by vehicles trying to go through or around the barricades.  </p>
            <p class="body_text">By focusing exclusively on the violence of a minority of protesters, and of the rioters who infiltrated their ranks, while ignoring the brutality of the police, the media has dutifully contributed to the official narrative of events and to the normalization of the violent policing of protests. On 5 December, for instance, the government declared that the protesters were ready to descend on the capital ‘to destroy and kill’. One frustrated <em>gilet jaune </em>resorted to addressing a television broadcast on Facebook: ‘thousands of peaceable yellow vests near the Opéra, in Paris—will you show these images?’ Responding to the pro-government slant of most media outlets, and their biased representations of the protests, the yellow vests have often showed hostility towards journalists, sometimes even assaulting them, and prefer to rely instead on social media and alternative news sites, where useful information as well as fake news abounds. </p>
            <p class="body_text">The irony is that the very mediasphere that has rightly been accused of vilifying the yellow vests and misrepresenting their protests has also given their movement the oxygen of publicity. Without the extensive coverage that they have enjoyed from the start, it is very unlikely that they would have received such extraordinary public attention. After all, other mobilizations in recent years have brought people out onto the streets without eliciting much interest, and a protest against a tax increase on fuel was not, on the face of it, a very exciting topic. What made a difference in the case of the yellow vests was the spectacle of violence. This is another paradox to be emphasized. The very images and narratives that showed the protesters in a negative light made them an attraction worldwide. This was not mere chance. Symbolic places and monuments were deliberately chosen as the stage for the crowd’s performance. Because the destructions and lootings during the third demonstration on 1 December mostly took place in France’s famed capital, the protest became a global phenomenon, eliciting supportive comments from across the political spectrum, from Salvini on the right to Sahra Wagenknecht on the left. It also generated similar mobilizations, from Belgium to Taiwan, and in Egypt a lawyer was sent to prison for having posted a picture of himself wearing a yellow vest. The French government now had to take this seriously. The majority of the population, although disapproving of the excesses of the crowd, continued to sympathize with the mobilization, as if it considered the physical violence of the protesters a comprehensible—if not justifiable—response to the structural violence of society.  </p>
          </div>
          <div id="D34905-06" class="subsection">
            <h4 id="H34905-06">
              <em>Sense and uncertainty </em>
            </h4>
            <p class="body_text">So close to the start of the yellow-vest mobilization, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about its meaning and future. The movement has too often been treated as <em>sui generis</em>, when in fact useful comparisons can be drawn with mobilizations that have occurred in Spain, Italy and Greece over the past decade. There are undoubtedly similarities: anger at diminished purchasing power and at the dysfunction of representative democracy; social and political heterogeneity of the protesters, with a significant role played by precarious workers and newcomers to militancy, especially women; occupation of public spaces and utilization of social media; absence of leaders and formal structures, at least in the early phases of these movements. Two factors might nevertheless singularize the French case: the channeling of people’s rage against the figure of the President, who has become the symbol of an arrogant and authoritarian neoliberalism, and the country’s history of struggles over the social state, which remains part of the collective imaginary. </p>
            <p class="body_text">These hypotheses will need to be confirmed. What can be said with some confidence is that the <em>gilets jaunes </em>mobilization constitutes an event in the strong sense of the term—that is, a moment which imposes a temporal rupture in the course of things, with a before and an after. The questioning of social injustice and democratic practices is certainly not new, but it has on this occasion resonated with the population at large, at least in the working class as broadly defined. It has also had interesting effects in the academic world. Rarely have social scientists and social theorists reacted so rapidly to the tumultuous course of events, at the risk of projecting their own desires and expectations, but with the merit of contributing to the collective vibrancy. Two months after the beginning of the movement, three books by multiple authors had already appeared at major publishers.<a href="https://newleftreview-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/issues/II115/articles/didier-fassin-anne-claire-defossez-an-improbable-movement#note-27" class="article-body__note-ref" id="reference-27"><span class="show-for-sr">footnote</span><sup>27</sup></a> This intellectual effervescence is a signal.  </p>
            <p class="body_text">So, too, is the proliferation of debates in all sectors of society. Not unexpectedly, many conservatives are dismissive or suspicious of the <em>gilets jaunes</em>, while most progressives are enthralled about their potential to free up a paralyzed social and political system, even if they are aware of the tensions and contradictions within the movement. By claiming that they are the people and by contesting the legitimacy of the elite, the yellow vests are arguably placing themselves in the populist tradition. However, not all populisms are identical. No one knows whether this movement will evolve toward a more recognizable form, but it has at least reminded French politicians of the existence of a category that had disappeared from their vocabulary: <em>les classes populaires</em>.  </p>
